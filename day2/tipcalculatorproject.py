'''*above example rounds $12.567 = 12.57 but can't round off i decimal to 2 decimal always .
 eg. 12 can't be 12.00 (if we want all values to be 2 decimal places filling zeroes)

*If you want the every final_amount to always have 2 decimal places.
 e.g. $12 becomes $12.00.

print(f'Each person should pay: ${final_amount:.2f}')
# {:.2f} is used for having 2 decimal places after decimal point for given float number
